### what we learned in lesson 1
##### the Differences , Advantages and Disadvantages of both CLI and -GUI
1. CLI is usually used by developers , much faster at excuting commands , can excute very complex operations with ease but requires a lot of knowledge to be used.
2. GUI have the ease of use and access , while slower since the visual data need to be converted into code.
3. CLI is basicly a terminal that uses fixed commands to excute actions in the system while GUI is Graphical User Interface that make excuting those actions much easier using visual aids
